Culture-Fit Interview: 
Jason L. Cruz (The Rebel) 
 
1. Work Environment Preference 
Interviewer: Describe a work environment where you felt most productive and engaged. 
Jason: 
“The best environment I’ve worked in is one that lets people bend the rules if they can prove it 
improves results. When I joined IgniteTech Systems, the company culture was extremely 
structured — every KPI was volume-based, and people were afraid to deviate. Within a month, I 
started challenging that. I told my VP, ‘What if we stop measuring the number of calls and start 
measuring the value of conversations?’ He gave me the freedom to test it in my region. My team 
focused on fewer but deeper client interactions, and within six months, revenue jumped 30%. 
That’s when I realized I thrive where leadership values experimentation over obedience.” 
 
2. Team Conflict Resolution 
Interviewer: Tell me about a disagreement you had with a team member. 
Jason: 
“At UrbanLeaf Ventures, I had a senior rep who clashed with me constantly. He believed our 
‘subscription-style’ pricing model would alienate traditional customers. I believed it was the 
future. Instead of forcing it, I bet him lunch for every client who renewed under the new model. I 
told him, ‘Let’s test it — you take half your accounts the old way, and I’ll take half the new 
way.’ After three months, my group had a 40% higher renewal rate. He laughed, bought me 
lunch, and became the program’s biggest advocate. Conflict doesn’t bother me; I just turn it into 
a competition with data as the referee.” 
 
3. Development and Growth 
Interviewer: What role should managers play in employee development? 
Jason: 
“I think managers should ignite people’s fire — not babysit it. When I worked at IronPeak 

Solutions, my manager, Carla, gave me one piece of advice that changed my career: ‘If you want 
to stand out, stop asking for permission to perform.’ I’ve carried that with me. When I coach my 
team now, I encourage them to run small experiments without waiting for approval — if they can 
justify it with logic or metrics. That autonomy develops confidence faster than any workshop.” 
 
4. Innovation and Change 
Interviewer: Tell me about a time when you had to do something new or untested. 
Jason: 
“When I joined IgniteTech, the Miami region had flat growth for two years. I discovered our 
reps were spending hours manually prospecting. I pushed for an automation platform — which 
IT rejected three times. So I built a lightweight version using free tools: Zapier, HubSpot, and 
LinkedIn Sales Navigator. We tested it quietly for 30 days. Productivity spiked 25%. When 
leadership saw the results, they approved full implementation. Sometimes you don’t need 
permission to innovate — you need proof.” 
 
5. Failure and Learning 
Interviewer: Describe a project that didn’t go as planned. 
Jason: 
“At UrbanLeaf, I once tried launching a guerrilla marketing campaign for our retail line — pop-
up sampling events in downtown areas. I thought it was brilliant. We underestimated logistics 
and weather. One event literally got rained out, and we lost $20K. I owned it, analyzed what 
went wrong, and salvaged the idea by moving it indoors with local partnerships. The second 
version generated $80K in net new sales. Failure’s fine — just don’t repeat it.” 
 
6. Future Orientation 
Interviewer: How do you balance long-term planning with reacting to change? 
Jason: 
“I plan in pencil. Every quarter, I create a strategic blueprint — market shifts, competitor 
tracking, emerging tech — but I review it biweekly. If something changes, I pivot. At 
IgniteTech, I saw AI integration coming before it was cool, so I allocated part of our budget to 
pilot automation early. That move helped us close deals faster while competitors were still 
drafting policies. I live by ‘act early, adjust later.’” 
 

7. Achievement and Goals 
Interviewer: Tell me about a significant goal you set for yourself. 
Jason: 
“When I joined UrbanLeaf, my goal was to turn our lowest-performing sales region into a top-
five performer within two years. I did it in 18 months. How? I restructured the comp plan — 
removed the cap and tied bonuses to experimentation. It was controversial, but it unleashed 
creativity. Reps tried new outreach ideas, and suddenly, the team was alive again. Sometimes the 
best goals are the ones that make people uncomfortable.” 
 
8. Pressure and Deadlines 
Interviewer: Describe a time when you worked under extreme pressure. 
Jason: 
“In my first quarter at IgniteTech, we had a $5M renewal pipeline and only two weeks left. 
Corporate wanted standard renewals; I wanted to upsell with automation bundles. My VP 
thought I was crazy to complicate it. I took the risk — trained my team overnight and 
restructured proposals. We closed 98% of renewals plus $1.3M in new business. High pressure 
sharpens my focus. It’s where my best decisions come from.” 
 
9. Success Definition 
Interviewer: How do you personally define success? 
Jason: 
“For me, success means making people rethink what’s possible. When I hear someone say, 
‘We’ve always done it this way,’ I get motivated. At IronPeak, I once convinced the leadership 
team to replace cold calling with creative LinkedIn video pitches. They thought it was 
unprofessional — until response rates doubled. Success isn’t comfort; it’s evolution.” 
 
10. Process and Structure 
Interviewer: Tell me about a time when you improved a work process. 
Jason: 
“At IgniteTech, approvals for enterprise quotes took three days. I hated that delay. I redesigned 
the workflow — cut unnecessary sign-offs and built an automated Slack notification for 

managers. Approval time dropped to six hours. The process didn’t just get faster; morale 
improved because reps finally felt momentum again.” 
 
11. Rules and Procedures 
Interviewer: Describe a time when following rules conflicted with achieving a goal. 
Jason: 
“At UrbanLeaf, corporate policy banned flexible pricing. One day, a major account told me 
they’d leave unless we customized terms. I took the risk and offered a pilot pricing structure 
without prior approval. It worked — the client renewed for three years. I presented the results 
afterward, and leadership made it the new policy. I’d rather apologize for success than ask 
permission for stagnation.” 
 
12. Quality and Consistency 
Interviewer: What does quality mean to you? 
Jason: 
“Quality means delivering results that force people to raise their standards. I tell my team, ‘Don’t 
just meet expectations — ruin the baseline.’ At IgniteTech, we replaced generic follow-ups with 
short, creative videos. Our clients started forwarding them internally — that’s impact. Quality 
isn’t about perfection; it’s about memorability.” 
 
13. Work Habits and Routines 
Interviewer: Walk me through a typical workday. 
Jason: 
“I start around 7 a.m. with a 20-minute run — it clears my head. My mornings are strategic: 
analyzing data, reading industry news, identifying opportunities to disrupt. Afternoons are for 
execution — calls, experiments, coaching. I end every day asking myself: ‘What rule did I 
challenge today?’ If the answer’s ‘none,’ I didn’t push hard enough.” 
 
14. Communication Style 
Interviewer: How do you prefer to communicate with your team? 

Jason: 
“Direct and honest — sometimes brutally honest. I hate sugarcoating. At IgniteTech, I hold 
weekly ‘truth sessions’ where anyone can challenge an idea — even mine. We’ve had heated 
debates, but they always lead to better outcomes. My rule: if it’s true and helps the mission, say 
it.” 
 
15. Decision-Making Philosophy 
Interviewer: What principles guide your decisions? 
Jason: 
“I make decisions fast, test them small, and scale what works. Perfection is paralysis. For 
example, when I introduced the automation project, I didn’t build a six-month roadmap — I built 
a one-week prototype. Action gives you data; hesitation gives you doubt.” 
 
16. Work-Life Integration 
Interviewer: What role does work play in your life? 
Jason: 
“Work and life are both arenas for creativity. I don’t really separate them — ideas hit me at 
dinner, and I’ll jot them down. But I’m also strict about recovery. I surf every Sunday and box 
twice a week — that’s how I reset. My energy at work comes from movement, not rest.” 
 
17. Ethical Framework 
Interviewer: Tell me about a time when you faced an ethical dilemma. 
Jason: 
“At IronPeak, a vendor offered me a ‘finder’s fee’ for steering clients their way. It was shady. I 
turned it down and told my boss. That vendor got blacklisted a month later for similar behavior. 
I’m aggressive, but I play fair. There’s a difference between breaking rules and breaking trust.” 
 
18. Human Nature and Trust 
Interviewer: What brings out the best performance in people? 

Jason: 
“Freedom and recognition. People will surprise you if you stop controlling them. I once let my 
top rep design his own compensation plan for a quarter — within reason. He ended up exceeding 
targets by 60%. Trust breeds creativity; control breeds compliance.” 
 
19. Truth and Knowledge 
Interviewer: How do you determine what’s true when opinions differ? 
Jason: 
“I don’t debate truth — I test it. At IgniteTech, marketing wanted to spend $50K on ads; I 
argued for content-driven outreach. Instead of fighting, I split the budget 50/50. After 30 days, 
my campaign outperformed theirs 3 to 1. Truth doesn’t need consensus — it needs evidence.” 
 
20. Time Orientation and Learning 
Interviewer: How do you approach learning from the past and planning for the future? 
Jason: 
“I treat every quarter like a lab. I run post-mortems not to assign blame but to extract lessons. At 
UrbanLeaf, we held ‘Failure Fridays’ — we’d share one mistake we made that week and what 
we learned from it. It normalized risk-taking and built resilience. The future belongs to teams 
that fail fast and recover faster.”
